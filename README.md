## Setup 
- [Setup](/SETUP.md)

## Progress

1. Completed Tasks

    - Set up the backend using the Node.js framework (Hapi.js).
    - Completed API implementation for the following:
        1. API to search for tutors, with filter options for subject, price, school, curriculum, and tutor (supports partial string matching).
        2. API to fetch tutor profile details.
        3. API to request a tutor.
    - Set up the frontend with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn.
    - Integrated the APIs with the frontend.
    - Implemented the following components:
        1. Search user interface:
            - Tutor card
            - Filters
            - Pagination
        2. Profile interface:
            - Tutor information
            - Contact section
2. Pending

    - None, as per the assignment requirements.
    - The authentication flow is not implemented, so I will explain how it would work:
        #### JWT Authentication

        1. When a user signs up, a JWT token will be generated on the server.
        2. This token will contain the necessary information to authenticate the user.
        3. After a successful signup, the JWT token is sent to the client.
        4. The user will use this token to request a resource, and it will be included in the header of each request.
        5. When a request is made, the server will first check if the user has a valid token and the required access.
        6. A middleware will be created to validate the token before processing the request.
        7. If the token is valid, the user will be granted access to the resource; otherwise, an unauthorized error will be thrown.
        
        #### Refresh Token Flow

        1. Along with the access token, a refresh token will also be issued during signup or login.
        2. The access token has a short expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes) to enhance security, while the refresh token has a longer expiration (e.g., 7 days).
        3. When the access token expires, the client will send a request to the server with the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
        4. The server will verify the refresh token's validity.
        5. If the refresh token is valid, a new access token is issued and sent to the client.
        6. This process ensures that users donâ€™t have to log in frequently, while maintaining security by keeping the access token short-lived.
        7. If the refresh token is invalid or expired, the user will be required to log in again.

## Challenges

1. Setting up a monorepo and configuring it took more time than expected.  
2. Writing a search query to include all possible filters was a bit tricky but manageable.  
3. On the frontend, deciding the UI design and implementing the functionality was time-consuming but not overly challenging.

## Future Aditions

1. Profile Views
    - Profile views will provide tutors with insights into how appealing their profile is.  
    - It will also offer insights into the type of users interested in their profile, allowing tutors to target specific users.  
2. Introductory Video on Tutor Profiles  
    - An introductory video will help potential clients understand the tutor better.  
3. Descriptive Public Reviews  
    - Reviews will enable users to make informed decisions before hiring a tutor.  
4. Live Chat for Inquiries
